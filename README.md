# ASL Letter Prediction with ResNet9 and PyTorch



I performed single label classification on a Kaggle dataset of ASL letters using PyTorch and ResNet9 deep learning architecture. The model can be used as the basis of computer vision ASL interpretation using the OpenCV library. The model achieved an accuracy of ~99%. Check out my Jupyter Notebook! :)
